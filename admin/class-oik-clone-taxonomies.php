/**
 * OIK_clone_taxonomies class 
 *
 * Provide client/server methods for managing taxonomy terms associated with posts 
 *
 * Note: This may only be needed for hierarchical taxonomies
 * The WordPress core APIs do not nicely deal with interchange of taxonomy terms between sites
 * 
 * - The unique IDs on one site are useless to another
 * - Similarly, we can't trust the values of slugs
 * - So we have to attempt to work with term names 
 * - While understanding the term tree hierarchy
 * 
 *
 * - You can have a term called "custom CSS" in multiple places in the tree.
 * - Each term has a unique slug
 * - So you can list all posts with that slug 
 * - And get just the ones you were aiming for
 * - But, if a user were to perform a query on the name, then you could get some odd results
 *
 * WordPress 4.2 is doing some work to sort out a number of challenges in this area.
 * This solution pays no attention to those problems.
 * Let's hope that the data structures are unchanged!
