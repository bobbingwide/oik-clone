# oik-clone
Clone content between sites

Oik-clone provides tools to merge and synchronise content between WordPress sites.
Version 0.1 was developed to merge content between Multisites, using a pull mechanism.
Version 0.2 will provide a push mechanism allowing content to be optionally cloned during post updates.

Oik-clone is dependent on the oik base plugin.
Both plugins need to be installed on each site.

This is a prototype solution to address a specific problem - performance comparison and improvement in multiple implementations. SEO is not a consideration.
