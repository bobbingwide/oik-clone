== Description ==
Clone content between sites


oik-clone provides tools to merge and synchronise content between WordPress sites.

Version 0.1 was developed to merge content between Multisites, using a pull mechanism.
It also supports post cloning in a single WordPress installation, though I can't really see a true need for it.

Version 0.2 provides a push mechanism, allowing content to be optionally cloned during post updates.

oik-clone is dependent on the oik base plugin.
Both plugins need to be installed and activated on each site.

This is a prototype solution to address a specific problem - performance comparison and improvement in multiple implementations. 
SEO is not a consideration.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the oik-clone plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/oik-clone' directory
1. Activate the oik-clone plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use oik options > Clone to access the admin interface

Install on both the client and server machines.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What does the Multi-Site tab do?

The initial version of this plugin is designed for use on WordPress MultiSite
where you have cloned an existing site into a new version, developed the new version
and now want to copy the new contents back into the existing site.

= What does the Self tab do? =

The Self tab allows for introspection.
It provides the same actions as the Multisite tab, but the source and target site is the same.
 
- You can use it to look at all your content in one big listing
- You may find duplicated content
- You can compare similar content
- You can duplicate content by performing Import


= How does the "Clone on update" work? =

This'll be documented in the FAQs on the site



= Is this suitable for pushing from Staging to Production? =

It depends.


= Does this use the REST API? =
Not yet. That was the plan. 
But it was a lot more complicated than first thought of. 
So I developed the solution as an extensible solution.
The oik-clone base logic supports
- Self
- Multisite

Extension plugins, yet to be published, will support
- REST
- WXR
 

= Why is this dependent upon oik? =
Some plugins use Composer to manage their dependencies, pulling in library functions from 
third party plugins hosted on GitHub and elsewhere.

The oik suite of plugins use common APIs from the oik base plugin.
There should be little overhead.
Even though oik implements over 80 shortcodes none of them are registered until shortcodes are actually needed.
oik attempts to OWN the problem; Only When Necessary.

One day perhaps the lowest level of oik base functions will be exported to a library
but in the mean time you have to download and activate oik to make this work.

= Are there limitations? =

Yes. Work is needed in the following areas.

- Hierarchicacl taxonomies are not handled
- Hierarchical content requires parent content to be cloned first
- Search and replace is not performed against content
- Search and replace is not performed against post_meta data which contains post IDs

= What authentication method is used? =
Simple validation of an API key.
