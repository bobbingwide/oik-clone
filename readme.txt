== Description ==
Compare site contents, clone and update.

The initial version of this plugin is designed for use on WordPress MultiSite
where you have cloned an existing site into a new version, developed the new version
and now want to copy the new contents back into the existing site.

It also supports post cloning in a single WordPress installation, though I can't really see a true need for it.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the oik-clone plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/oik-clone' directory
1. Activate the oik-clone plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use oik options > Clone to access the admin interface
